# Fourier Analysis as Streamlit Web App
[![**Open in Streamlit**](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://omaralkousa-fourier-analysis-as-streamlit-web-app-app-kvqic3.streamlit.app/)

This web app allows you to decompose your signals or time series using FFT and gives the opportunity to interactively investigate the signal and its spectrum using the advantage of **Plotly** package. All you have to do is to upload the file of the signal **(.csv)** and specify the **sampling rate**. Additional properties (optional) can be edited like the title of each time and freuquency figures, the labels of the y-axes, and the the color line of each time and frequency data.

For more information about Fourier Transform, check out this [**post**](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/learn-discrete-fourier-transform-dft-9f7a2df4bfe9) on Towards Data Science and see the how it works mathematically. Also, if you are interested in how to implement the FFT algorithm in Python, follow this [**post**](https://towardsdatascience.com/fourier-transform-the-practical-python-implementation-acdd32f1b96a).

Below is an illustration of the app while using Fourier Analysis on the [example](https://github.com/OmarAlkousa/Fourier-Analysis-as-Streamlit-Web-App/blob/6ad90c593344ed7b04f7d9b9246e3298b3f46d2f/example.csv) signal.
